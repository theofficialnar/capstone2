Bugs to squish:

Things to do:
- set up proper layout for skill sim
- make front page and credits page
- include contact me and socials on the bottom of the side nav

To add if there's still enough time:
- set up commenting and rating option on saved build pages
- set option for each user to change dp and bg pic on side nav
- set jumping poring as page preloader
- replace dropdowns on skill db and sim with character sprites (will stand up when hovered)
