Bugs to squish:

Things to do:
- make credits page
- include contact me and socials on the bottom of the side nav
- fix skill sim view on mobile devices
- set proper validations for registering

To add if there's still enough time:
- set up top builds tab on front page
- create generate reports option on skill sim
- set jumping poring as page preloader
- replace dropdowns on skill db and sim with character sprites (will stand up when hovered)
