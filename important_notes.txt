Bugs to squish:
- skills set to auto 0 not refunded to total unused skill point counter
- "10" on skill sim get's cut off on IE

Things to do:
- put edit/delete buttons on skill db for admin
- set up proper layout for skill sim
- make skill sim save button only available for logged in users
- make front page and credits page
- include contact me and socials on the bottom of the side nav

To add if there's still enough time:
- make a page where people can view saved builds
- set up commenting and rating option on saved build pages
- set option for each user to change dp and bg pic on side nav
- set jumping poring as page preloader
- replace dropdowns on skill db and sim with character sprites (will stand up when hovered)
