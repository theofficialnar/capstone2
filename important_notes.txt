Bugs to squish:

Things to do:
- create my account page to change pw etc
- polish edit skill and delete skill layouts from skill_db
- polish front page
- make credits page
- include contact me and socials on the bottom of the side nav
- polish comment's section on build view
- fix skill sim view on mobile devices
- change log in modal's password focus color and button color
- set proper validations for registering

To add if there's still enough time:
- set option for each user to change dp and bg pic on side nav
- create generate reports option on skill sim
- set jumping poring as page preloader
- replace dropdowns on skill db and sim with character sprites (will stand up when hovered)
