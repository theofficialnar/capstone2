Bugs to squish:

Things to do:
- set proper validations for registering
- make manual on how to use page
- add delete comment option on build view

To add if there's still enough time:
- create generate reports option on skill sim
- set jumping poring as page preloader
- replace dropdowns on skill db and sim with character sprites (will stand up when hovered)
